<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Panna cotta is a traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. I had a difficult time finding a good, simple recipe on the Internet, so I made up my own recipe. It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants. Serve with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries on top. This keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>⅓ cup skim milk</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.</li>
    <li>Immediately stir gelatin mixture into boiling cream, stirring until completely dissolved. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
    <li>Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until no longer warm, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>When cool, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.</li>
